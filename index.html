        <strong class="cc"> – Elon Musk</strong>
        <h2> Early life</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Childhood and family</h3>
        <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[4] His mother is Maye Musk (née
            Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[5][6][7] but raised in South Africa. His
            father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property
            developer.[8] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[7][9]
            His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[10][11] and Musk has British and
            Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[12][13] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father
            in Pretoria and elsewhere,[12] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[14]
            Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil
            thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[14] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's
            side.[10][15]

            Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore
            VIC-20.[16][17] He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a
            BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately
            $500.[18][19] An awkward and introverted child,[20] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once
            hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[14][21] He attended Waterkloof House
            Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[22]</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[23] Musk applied for a Canadian passport
        through his Canadian-born mother.[24][25] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of
        Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[26]
        Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate a great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth
        hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan.[27] He stayed there for a year,
        working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[28] In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston,
        Ontario.[29][30] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a
        Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[31][32][33]

        In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle
        Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based
        startup Rocket Science Games.[34] In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in
        materials science at Stanford University in California.[35] Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never
        received a response to his inquiries.[24] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join
        the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.[36]
        <h2>Business career</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Zip2</h3>
        <p>In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.[14]
            They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[37] The company developed and marketed an
            Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[38] Musk
            says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an
            office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. According
            to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the
            time."[37] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[39] and
            persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[40] Musk's attempts to
            become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin,[41] were thwarted by the board.[42] Compaq acquired
            Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999.[43][44] Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent
            share.[45][46]</p>

        <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
        <p>In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[47] The startup was
            one
            of the first online banks to be federally insured, and, within its initial months, over 200,000 customers
            joined
            the service.[48] The company's investors saw Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill
            Harris by the end of the year.[49] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to prevent
            unnecessary competition.[37][49][50] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[51] Confinity had its own
            money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.[45][52] Within the merged
            company,
            Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and
            caused Thiel to resign.[53] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the
            board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[54][note 3] Under Thiel, the company
            focused on
            the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[56][57] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5
            billion
            in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7%—received over $100 million.[58][59]

            In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has
            sentimental
            value.[60][61]</p>
        <h3>SpaceX</h3>
        <p>In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a
            growth-chamber
            for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.[62] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow
            to
            buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into
            space.
            He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on
            by
            one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002,
            the
            group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered
            one
            rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build
            affordable
            rockets.[63] With $100 million of his early fortune,[64] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp.,
            traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.[65] As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of
            Chief
            Engineer.[66]

            After three failed launches, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 in 2008. It was the first private
            liquid-fuel rocket to reach Earth orbit.[67] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial
            Resupply
            Services program contract for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International
            Space
            Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[68] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with
            the
            ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[69] Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX
            successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.[70] Landings were later achieved on an autonomous
            spaceport
            drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform.[71] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural
            mission carried a Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[72][73] In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation
            launch
            vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which would support all SpaceX launch service
            provider
            capabilities.[74] In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight
            called dearMoon project.[75] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first manned flight, the Demo-2, becoming the
            first
            private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed space-craft with the ISS.[76]</p>
        <h3>Tesla</h3>
        <p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who
            financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[82] Both men played active roles in the company's
            early development prior to Musk's involvement.[83] Musk led the Series A round of investment in 2004,
            joining
            Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[84][85] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw
            Roadster
            product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[86] Following a series of
            escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[87][88] Musk
            assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[89] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with
            Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[2][3]

            Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was
            the
            first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[90] Tesla began delivery of its
            four-door Model S sedan in 2012;[91] a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[92][93] A mass market
            sedan, the Model 3 was released in 2017.[94][95] As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric
            car,
            with more than 500,000 units delivered.[96] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in
            2020.[97]
            The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[98][99] Under Musk, Tesla has also
            constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1
            in
            Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.[100][101][102]

            Since its initial public offering in 2010,[103] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most
            valuable
            carmaker in summer 2020.[104][105] It entered the S&P 500 later that year.[106][107]</p>
        <h3>Neuralink</h3>
        <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with AI.
            Neuralink's purpose is to create devices that are embedded in the human brain to facilitate the merging of
            the
            brain with machines. The devices will also reconcile with the latest improvements in artificial intelligence
            to
            stay updated. Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more
            effectively.[134][135]

            At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your
            skull"
            that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and
            publications criticized these claims;[136][137][138] MIT Technology Review described them as "highly
            speculative" and "neuroscience theater".[136]</p>
        <h3>The Boring Company</h3>
        <p>In 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels.[139] In early 2017, they began discussions
            with
            regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot
            (4.6 m)
            deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices as it required no permits.[140] A tunnel beneath the
            Las
            Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[141] Local officials have approved further expansions
            of
            the tunnel system.[142]

            As a merchandising and publicity stunt, The Boring Company sold 2,000 novelty flamethrowers in
            2018.[143][144]
            The idea was allegedly inspired by the Mel Brooks-directed film Spaceballs (1987).[145][146]</p>
        <h2>Other activities</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Hyperloop</h3>
        <p>In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain, assigning a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX
            to
            establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[156] On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled the
            concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[157] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper
            posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[158] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional
            route
            where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay
            Area
            at an estimated total cost of $6 billion.[159] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has
            cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[160]

            In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate
            on
            a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January
            2017,
            and Musk also announced that the company started a tunnel project with Hawthorne airport as its
            destination.[161] In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received "verbal government approval" to build a
            hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[162] Mention
            of
            the project for the DC to Baltimore part were removed from the Boring Company website later in 2021.[163]
        </p>
        <h3>OpenAI</h3>
        <p>In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI)
            research
            company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to
            humanity.[164] A
            particular focus of the company is to "counteract large corporations [and governments] who may gain too much
            power by owning super-intelligence systems".[165][14] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible
            future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla
            Autopilot.[166]</p>
        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University, and they married
            in 2000.[302] Their first child, son Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at
            the age of 10 weeks.[303] The couple divorced in 2008 and share custody of their five surviving
            children.[302][304][305]

            In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010, the couple married. In 2012, Musk
            announced a divorce from Riley.[306][307][308] In 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk
            filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.[309] A second divorce was
            finalized in 2016.[310] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[311][312] he had reportedly
            been pursuing her since 2012.[312] Musk was later accused of having an affair with Heard while she was still
            married to Johnny Depp.[313][314]

            In May 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.[315][316][317] Grimes gave
            birth to their son in May 2020.[318][319] According to Musk and Grimes, his name was "X Æ A-12"; however,
            the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern
            English alphabet,[320][321] and was then changed to "X Æ A-Xii". This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a
            letter in the modern English alphabet.[322] The child was eventually named "X AE A-XII", with "X" as a first
            name and "AE A-XII" as a middle name.[323]

            From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded
            and where their headquarters are still located.[324] In 2020, Musk moved to Texas, stating that California
            had become "complacent" with its economic success.[324][325]</p>
